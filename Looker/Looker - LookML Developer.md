### Chaining fields together

* In Looker, you can create various dimensions based on existing fields. An example covered in this course is adding dimensions to represent sales data in different states (including tax and employee spend deductions).
* Dimensions were created for:
    * Sales
    * Sales plus a 13% tax
    * Sales plus tax minus a 20% employee spend
* Issues can arise when multiple dimensions reference a hard-coded value (e.g., the 13% tax rate), as changing this value in the future would require updates in multiple places.
* To optimize this, you can "chain" fields, using references to other fields instead of hard-coded values, facilitating future updates:
    * Utilize LookML features to reference fields using the dollar sign and curly braces (e.g., `${sales_with_tax}`).
    * Through field chaining, changes made in one field automatically update in all the fields that reference it, avoiding the need to update each field individually when there is a change in a variable, like tax rate changes.
* The course illustrated how to change the foundational field (sales) and showed how it auto-updated the chained fields, emphasizing the efficiency of this method for managing data with variable components.
* Training in LookML encourages adopting practices like field chaining to build more adaptable, efficient data models.

Note: Please ensure that you clearly understood the concept of field chaining as it will be a recurrent topic in future lessons. Adjustments and references were demonstrated live to showcase the advantages of using field chaining for maintaining accurate, easily updated data structures.

### Measures - aggregations

- The lecture focused on how to create and utilize measures in Looker.
- Measures are a vital part of Looker, helping in defining various parameters for data analytics.
  - To create a measure, add a measure parameter and assign it an identifier.
  - Initially, two measures were created: count and total sales.
    - Count: Defines a count of rows that meet a specific condition.
    - Total Sales: Aggregates the total sales from a specified sales column.
- Different types of measures can be added such as average sales by specifying the type and associating it with the correct SQL column.
- Measures operate in three categories:
  - Aggregation metrics (e.g., average, sum, max, median).
  - Non-aggregation metrics.
  - Post-aggregation metrics.
- A unique measure type discussed was "list," which:
  - Doesn't combine multiple numbers into one but lists all other numbers.
  - Requires defining a "list field" and not a sequel parameter.
- The practical part of the lecture involved creating different measures and viewing the results, helping to visualize transaction details more vividly.
- It was emphasized to refer to Looker docs to understand various types of measure functionalities, including the necessary parameters for each type.
- The next lectures would cover non-aggregate and post-aggregate types of measures in detail.

### Measures - non-aggregations

- In this lecture, the discussion revolves around non-aggregate measures in Looker.
- The lecturer emphasized their personal view that non-aggregate measures are generally not worth using because:
  - The primary function of measures is to amalgamate multiple numbers into a single figure, which non-aggregate measures do not do.
  - Incorporating a dimension with a non-aggregate measure isn’t feasible.
- Despite their personal stance against non-aggregate measures, the lecturer explores how to create one for instructional purposes:
  - A non-aggregate sales measure was crafted utilizing “no” as the type and referencing it to "Table Dot Sales."
  - The attempt to use this non-aggregate measure with a dimension resulted in an error, illustrating the incompatibility between non-aggregate measures and dimensions.
- It was underscored that non-aggregate measures can only be used in isolation, without associating them with any dimension.
- The lecturer argued that utilizing sales as a dimension instead of creating a non-aggregate measure would be more practical and couldn’t find a substantial reason to prefer non-aggregate measures.
- In closing, the lecturer noted that understanding non-aggregate measures might be necessary for Looker certification and hence included it in the course for completeness and preparation for potential examination content.

(Note: The summary is optimized for pasting into Obsidian and does not use markdown titles, complying with your request.)

### Measures - post-SQL types

In this Looker online course lecture, the instructor introduced "Post Sequel" measures, a kind of measure that performs specific calculations after the data has been aggregated. Here's a summarized overview:

- Definition of Post Sequel measures:
  - Operate on aggregated data.
  - Apply specific calculations after data has been summed up.

- Practical application explained with transaction IDs and sales data:
  - Showcase of a simple aggregation where each transaction shows the total sales amount.
  - Creation of a new measure to display the sales as a percentage of the total sales.
    - Cannot refer to a specific column but to an aggregate measure.
    - Utilization of LookML language for referencing another field or table; shown with the use of dollar sign and curly braces.
    
- Demonstration of how to create a Post Sequel measure:
  - Naming it as “percent of total sales”.
  - Referencing it to the "total sales" aggregate measure using LookML language, followed by saving and refreshing the page to add the new measure.
  - Running the page showcased the new measure indicating the sales percentage of individual transactions.

- Flexibility of the function:
  - Facilitating easy switch from transaction ID to other categories like states to analyze data more efficiently.
  - Offers ease in conducting complex operations which would have required multiple steps in SQL, automatically executed in LookML.
  
- Note on user convenience:
  - While users can add custom fields for similar calculations, creating a designated column through this method saves time and avoids repetitive work.

This tutorial educated attendees on adding post-sequel measure types in Looker, enhancing the efficiency of data analysis. It underscored the benefits of creating specific columns for frequently used calculations to simplify tasks for analysts and other users.

### Dimension groups

In this Looker online course session, the concept of dimension groups was explored. Here is a summarized rundown:

- **Introduction to dimension groups**:
  - Used to group date and time dimensions together.
  - Facilitates creating dimensions based on different time frames, like month, quarter, or year.

- **Creating a dimension group**:
  - Initiated by going into LookML and adding a dimension group under the transaction date section.
  - Requires setting an identifier and specifying the type as time (since transaction date is time-based).
  - Allows setting available time frames, although it was left unspecified during the demo to show the defaults available.

- **Specifying parameters for dimension groups**:
  - **Data type**: Defines what kind of data the column will contain, in this case, dates.
  - **SQL**: Determines the field from which the column will pull data; here it pulls from the transaction date field.
  - Post-saving changes, refreshing the page availed various time frames (like year, week, month) for transaction data analysis.
  
- **Applying dimension groups**:
  - Enables viewing data by various time frames including by year, quarter, and month, offering a more detailed insight compared to just the date.
  - Has certain limitations on granularity; time of day, for instance, isn't applicable due to the base data only having date-level detail.

- **Customizing time frames**:
  - Can specify which time frames to make available, avoiding irrelevant options for better efficiency.
  - The demo showed refinement to date, week, month, and year, along with the raw column, to narrow down the available options.
  
- **Noteworthy points**:
  - Dimension groups can essentially replace the individual transaction date column, as it includes the raw version.
  - Several other parameters available in LookML can be explored for a deeper understanding, with some being explored in upcoming sections of the course.
  - The most used parameters include type, time frames, data type, and SQL while other parameters apply commonly in other dimensions and measures.

The session demystified the creation and application of dimension groups in Looker, detailing the steps and parameters involved, and emphasizing the ease it brings in breaking down transaction data to more precise time frames for detailed analysis. It was suggested to keep the existing transaction date for now to note the distinction between it and the new dimension group, with the encouragement to explore other available parameters in LookML for more depth of understanding.

### Filters

In this session of the Looker online course, the focus was on understanding and utilizing filters in Looker. Here’s the summary:

- **Concept of filters**:
  - Filters are similar to dimensions, providing an avenue to create filters but not add to the underlying dataset.
  - Often less used compared to dimensions.

- **Creating a filter**:
  - Example demonstrated was creating an "Office ID" filter.
  - Necessary parameters:
    - **Type**: Specified as a string for the “Office ID” filter.
    - **SQL**: Reference to the column, in this case, “Table.Dot.Offsite” was used to reference the "Office ID" column.
  - Once created, it appeared under the “filter only fields” and not under dimensions; users can apply it as a filter but can’t add it to the result dataset.

- **Converting a filter to a dimension**:
  - Showed how one can easily change a filter to a dimension by replacing the "filter" keyword with "dimension".
  - Post this change, "Office ID" was available under dimensions and could still be used as a filter; illustrating that all dimensions can essentially function as filters.

- **Key takeaways**:
  - Any dimension can be used to create a filter and a result set.
  - Filters are exclusively for creating filters; they can’t be utilized to forge elements in the resulting dataset.
  - Utilizing filters might be an optional tool as usually individuals discern whether to use a field for filtering or adding it as a dimension.
  - Understanding the distinction between dimensions and filters is essential, even coming up frequently in certification exams.

The session adeptly handled the filters feature in Looker, emphasizing its traits and drawing a clear line between it and dimensions. Although filters are less commonly employed, knowing their functionality can be advantageous, especially for individuals aiming for certification. The "Office ID" example vividly depicted how to set up and manipulate a filter, offering learners a tangible insight into working with filters in Looker. It was pointed out that the tool could be discretionary, depending on the preferences of the individual users.

## Beginner - Field Parameters

### Labels

## Intermediate Joins

### Join data

In this lecture segment of the Looker online course, the topic discussed is how to join two views together. Here is the summarized version of the relevant details:

- **Task for the Students**
  - **Preparation**: Before the lecture starts, students are asked to find and use a file named “additional file adjoin” from either the Resources tab or the reference material.
  - **File Contents**: This file contains two predefined views: “product” and “office,” each containing various data fields, such as product ID, office ID, product name, office name, etc. along with dimensions and measures associated with them. 

- **Utilizing Predefined Views**
  - **Product Table**: Includes details such as product ID, name, category, and hourly price, alongside the respective dimensions and measures, which students are expected to be familiar with at this point in the course.
  - **Office Table**: Consists of details including the office ID, name, zip code, and salesperson ID.

- **Joining Process**
  - **Location**: Students are instructed to place the copied views from the file below the "sales view" and above the "Sales Explorer" in LookML.
  - **Goal**: The ultimate objective is to integrate these two new tables with the existing sales table in LookML to facilitate more comprehensive data analysis.

The instructor emphasizes the importance of correctly positioning the pasted views in LookML and encourages students to reach out with any queries they may have during this process. This segment sets the stage for learning how to join different views together using Looker, enhancing the depth of data analysis possibilities.

### Basic join parameters

In this Looker online course segment, the instructor explains how to join views within Looker's explorer and the important considerations that come into play while doing so:

- **Views and Their Details**
  - **Transaction level table**: contains data such as the date of the transaction, officer ID, etc.
  - **Product table**: contains information on where a product is, its name, etc.
  - **Office view**: provides details about different office dimensions and properties.

- **Joining Views**
  - **Access limitation**: initially, there was no access to office names or product names in the transactions explorer.
  - **Objective**: to join other views, in this case, the office view to the sales view to access more details.

- **Setting Up a Join**
  - **Identifier**: generally matches the name of the view you are joining.
  - **Parameters**: involve defining the type of join (options being left outer, full outer, inner, and cross) and specifying the relationship.
  - **Join Types**
    - **Left Outer**: retains all records in the sales table, even if there is no match in the office table.
    - **Inner**: keeps only the records where there is a match.
    - **Full Outer and Cross**: used in specific cases, to keep records from both tables or to create a record for each combination from both tables, respectively.
  - **Sequel On**: defines what the views are being joined on, in this case, the office ID in both the sales and office views.
  - **Relationship**: can be many-to-one, many-to-many, or one-to-many, in this scenario, it is many-to-one.

- **Implementing the Join**
  - **Outcome**: after successfully setting up the join, one could access dimensions like office name and zip code in the explorer, which were defined in the office view, facilitating a more detailed analysis of sales data.
  - **Error handling**: the instructor corrected a mistake where a filter had been defined twice, illustrating the importance of careful setup.
  - **Examples**
    - Demonstrated the effect of a left outer join where a non-existent office ID was retained in the data.
    - Showed how changing to an inner join removed the record with the non-existent office ID, hence emphasizing the differences between a left and inner join.

- **Resources**
  - Encouraged learners to refer to available tutorials and resources to understand database languages and join relationships better.
  - Suggested moving to advanced sections for detailed understanding but reassured that the current knowledge is sufficient for simple joins.

This session guided learners in understanding and utilizing joins in Looker to enhance data exploration, stressing on the parameters and types of joins, and demonstrating the procedure and outcomes with practical examples.

### From parameter

In this Looker online course snippet, the topic covered is the utilization of additional join parameters, focusing specifically on the "from" parameter. Here is a concise summary emphasizing the essential details:

- The "from" parameter is used when defining joins in Looker; it is pivotal when the join identifier does not directly correspond to the view you aim to join.
- In the instance demonstrated, an identifier named "office to sales" is created, but this leads to a problem as Looker cannot identify the correct table to join since there isn't any table named "office to sales".
- The solution is to utilize the "from" parameter to explicitly state that the joining is happening from the "office" view.
- This process allows users to name the identifier as they wish while guiding Looker to the accurate view for the join.
- The right-hand side panel in Looker aids in describing the function and application of the "from" parameter clearly, indicating that it specifies the view used in the join and enables referencing fields from the chosen view through the join name. 

Ensure you understand how to properly use the "from" parameter to facilitate correct joins in Looker, naming identifiers as desired without causing issues in identifying the correct view to join.

### Restricting fields

In the presented part of the Looker online course, the instruction revolves around the "fields" parameter used within a join. Here is the summary emphasizing the key points:

- The "fields" parameter in Looker can be used to specify which fields you want to make available in an explorer when defining a join.
- In the example given, the "office view" has defined several dimensions: "office ID", "office name", and "office zip code". However, there might be situations where you want to restrict users from accessing certain fields, such as "office zip code", in a particular explorer.
- Deleting the dimension is not a suitable solution because you might need it in a different explorer. Hence, the "fields" parameter is applied to retain only chosen dimensions in your join, without removing them entirely.
- To use the "fields" parameter, input the exact string names of the fields you wish to keep; in the case demonstrated, only "office ID" and "office name" were retained.
- After saving changes and refreshing the page, the "office zip code" no longer appears, illustrating that the "fields" parameter effectively limits the fields that end up in the final joined table.
- Note that the dollar sign method does not work here, and field references are required.

Understanding the "fields" parameter will allow you to manage what dimensions are available in different explorers efficiently, providing control over the data that is accessible in various contexts while setting up joins in Looker.

### Where parameter

In this portion of the Looker online course, the instructor discusses the "sql_where" parameter in Looker. Here is the simplified and structured overview:

- The "sql_where" parameter in Looker is used to execute a WHERE SQL statement only when a join is initiated in the Explorer.
- Although not frequently used, it can be employed to filter results based on certain conditions during a join; for instance, limiting the displayed office IDs to a specified range.
- In the demonstration:
  - Initially, all office IDs (up to 10) are accessible.
  - The instructor adjusts the "sql_where" parameter to restrict the office IDs to a range of 1 to 5.
  - To implement this, the syntax utilized is `where office_id in (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`.
- Following the changes:
  - Before activating an office field from the join, the total sales displayed amount to 449,000.
  - Once the "office name" field is incorporated from the office join, the SQL statement activates, filtering the data to only include office IDs 1 to 5, thereby altering the total sales to 220,000.
- It's highlighted that the "sql_where" parameter can cause confusion for users because it can drastically change data outputs when certain fields are used in the analysis.
- A potential solution to prevent user confusion is to add a descriptive note within the "office name" or "office ID" field to indicate the applied filter, ensuring users are aware that results will be limited to office IDs between 1 and 5 when using fields from the office view.

Understanding the "sql_where" parameter is essential as it offers a method to control data displayed in explorations, although it should be used judiciously due to its potential to cause confusion. It enables the setup of automatic filters, promoting accurate data representation by restricting unwanted data in specified scenarios.

## Intermediate - Actions

### Quick start analysis

* The tutorial discusses the implementation of the **query parameter** in Looker to facilitate quickstart options for frequent analyses done by users.
* Setting up a quick start involves defining **dimensions** and **measures** that are often used in analyses in the query parameter, saving users time by presenting a pre-built analysis option.
  * Dimensions and measures refer to the criteria used in the analyses, such as sales by office name or state.
* Developers can retrieve the **LookML** code for the specific analysis setup by clicking on the “Get LookML” option; this can then be used to manually set up a query parameter.
  * Although using "Get LookML" is recommended, the tutorial demonstrated how to manually set up the parameter because of slow loading times during the session.
* Adding a **description** to your query helps in giving users a brief idea of what the analysis is about; it appears at the bottom of the quickstart option.
* The queries also allow for further customization such as:
  * **Grouping** different explores together.
  * **Adding filters** to narrow down the data presented.
  * **Limiting** the data to show, for instance, only the top 10 results.
  * **Sorting** the results in a specific manner.
  * Adding **pivots**, which allow for column-based dimensions as opposed to row-based.
* Users can create **multiple queries** in a single explorer, offering various quickstart options for different frequent analyses.
* Queries can also be defined outside of the explorer and pasted into the relevant section, though this is not commonly done.
* This feature assists in optimizing user experience by simplifying recurrent analyses, although it is noted to potentially bypass the creation of dashboards and reports for recurring analyses.

### Drill fields

- In this lecture, the use and customization of **drill fields** in Looker were discussed. 

- **Drill fields** allow users to delve deeper into data by clicking on a number to see the underlying data that make up that number:
  - Available at both view and individual field levels, offering different functionalities.
  - Defined by listing the fields to be displayed upon clicking a number.

- Steps to set up a drill field at the view level:
  - Navigate to the sales view.
  - Position the cursor between derived tables and dimension.
  - Input fields to display upon clicking a data point, such as Transaction ID and sales amount.
  - Save the changes and refresh the page to see the updated drill fields.

- **Customizing Drill Fields**:
  - Individual field-level customization is possible to show different details when clicking different data points.
  - Adding a drill field parameter in a specific measure will override the view-level default.
  - Refresh the page to see the different drill fields upon clicking on different data metrics.

- **User Benefits**:
  - Helps in breaking down aggregate numbers to individual transactions.
  - Enables users to explore data by creating tables in their explore view.
  - Users can download results or add more columns for a comprehensive view.

- **Best Practices**:
  - Field-level drill fields are less frequently used as providing more information is generally favored over less.
  - However, field-level usage can help in showcasing specific information for a better customized user experience.

Note that this summary is optimized for pasting into Obsidian and avoids the use of # titles as per your request.

### Links 1

In this Looker course session, the main focus is on understanding and utilizing links to enhance the user experience. Here is the summary of the key points discussed:

- **Links in Looker**: These are tools that facilitate user actions directly from the Looker platform. They can direct users to more detailed information or even initiate an email regarding a specific data point.

- **Implementing Links**: Links are inserted at the dimension level. They comprise of three elements:
  - *Label*: Specifies the action prompt, such as "Get more information."
  - *URL*: Defines where the link directs to; initially set to "google.com" for demonstration.
  - *Liquid variables*: Utilized to create dynamic links that adjust based on the specific data point chosen. They involve using curly braces to denote variable sections of the URL.

- **Testing and Customizing Links**:
  - *Individualized Links*: By including liquid variables within the URL, users are directed to pages that correspond to the exact office name they clicked on.
  - *Multiple Links*: Users have the ability to add numerous links for different actions, including sending an email to a specific office, which was demonstrated using a "mailto:" link coupled with hypothetical email addresses.
  
- **Email Links**:
  - *Creating*: Implemented using a "mailto:" link along with an email address which can be populated using liquid variables to match the data point.
  - *Functionality*: Clicking on the email link initiates the user's default email application with the designated email address pre-filled in the "to" field.

This session equips you with the knowledge to create functional, dynamic links within Looker, allowing you to streamline actions such as searching for more details or initiating emails directly from the Looker platform. It touches upon liquid variables, a topic to be covered extensively in a later advanced section of the course.

### Links 2

In this session of the Looker online course, the main focus is on enhancing the visual representation of links through the use of iconic URLs. Here’s a brief summary of the important details discussed:

- **Iconic URLs**: These are an additional parameter that can be added to links to make them more visually intuitive and user-friendly.
  
- **Implementation**:
  - *Get More Information Link*: Associated with an image that is relevant to Google to indicate that it directs to a Google search page.
  - *Mail Office Link*: Linked with the Gmail logo to suggest that it initiates an email action using Gmail.

- **Benefits**:
  - *Visual Appeal*: Incorporating iconic URLs brings a pleasing aesthetic to the links.
  - *User Convenience*: Iconic URLs provide a visual clue, allowing users to quickly understand the action associated with a link, thereby improving the user experience.

In conclusion, utilizing iconic URLs with links in Looker is a simple way to enhance user experience by providing visual cues about what each link does, making it both intuitive and aesthetically pleasing. It is a step beyond just having descriptive text, bringing in an element of visual identification to facilitate quicker user understanding.

### Setting actions

In this Looker online course session, the concept of adding actions to links was detailed, focusing on enhancing user interactivity through Looker. Below is a concise summary:

- **Introduction to actions in Looker**:
  - **Links**: Existing feature that allows users to navigate to other pages or open their mail client from a Looker dashboard.
  - **Forms**: New functionality enabling users to make HTTP (FTP mentioned but it seems like a mistake, HTTP was discussed) requests to external websites through Looker.

- **Creating an Action**:
  - **Dimension Addition**: Added customer ID as a new dimension, defining it as a string.
  - **Defining the Action**: Set up an action titled "notify user," associating it with a URL and an icon for visual representation.
  - **Endpoint Configuration**: Hypothetically defined an endpoint "example.com," which was set up to receive customer ID and a message parameter.
   
- **Setting up Parameters**:
  - **Automatic Parameter**: Automatically fetching the customer ID from the selected data.
  - **Form Parameter**: Creating a field for users to input a message (a string).

- **Demonstration and Error Resolution**:
  - **Error Encountered**: Faced an error due to a missing keyword in the setup, which was later resolved.
  - **Test Run**: Demonstrated the setup with a test run, acknowledging that the endpoint is not real and the test would fail.

- **Application Scenarios**:
  - **Dynamic Payloads**: Highlighted the potential to create dynamic payloads, allowing for diverse functionalities based on the endpoint’s capabilities.
  - **Additional Form Parameters**: Explained the addition of other parameters like refund amount to the form.

- **Potential with Real Endpoints**:
  - **Integration with Common Apps**: Mentioned the possibility of integrating with common apps like Slack, Power Automate, Gmail, Outlook, and Salesforce, each having their endpoints for more complex and useful actions.

- **Closing**:
  - **Power of Looker**: Emphasized the flexibility Looker offers in creating dynamic actions based on user inputs and selected data.
  - **Open for Queries**: Encouraged learners to reach out if they found the topic confusing.

*Note*: It's emphasized that the effectiveness of this function depends largely on having an endpoint that can correctly process the HTTP requests made by Looker. It's a powerful feature allowing for a wide array of functionalities, greatly depending on the endpoint’s processing capabilities. It's recommended to pair this feature with real endpoints to utilize its full potential.

### Adding suggestions 1

Here is your summary optimized for pasting into a .md file:

- In the lecture, the utility of using **suggestions** in Looker was discussed, especially in scenarios involving large datasets with hundreds of thousands of rows.
- Typically, Looker automatically creates filter values by performing a **"select distinct"** query to find all unique values for a filter, which can be slow for large datasets.
- **To optimize**, you can manually set suggestions for a filter:
  - Navigate to the relevant dimension setting (e.g., office name) in the LookML model.
  - Add a parameter named **“suggestions”**, followed by a list of strings representing the filter suggestions (e.g., "Austin", "Dallas").
  - Save the changes and refresh the page in Looker to see the update.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Speed**: It’s faster as Looker uses the provided suggestions directly instead of executing a database query.
  - **Control**: You can limit the filter options available to users based on what you provide in the suggestions parameter.
- It is highlighted that this is useful when the distinct values are known and static, allowing for both improved speed and control over the available filter options in Looker.

### Adding suggestions 2

Here is your summary optimized for pasting into a .md file:

- In the lecture, an alternative method of setting up suggestions in Looker was covered:
  - **Options for suggestions**:
    - Specify a list of strings manually (as covered in a previous lecture).
    - Direct Looker to derive suggestions from a different column.
  - This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets to **avoid slow "select distinct" queries**. 
  - **Example**:
    - In a sales table scenario with a massive number of records, instead of using a "select distinct" query on the office names column (which is extensive), you can instruct Looker to use a different column with fewer unique values, such as a column in a different explorer that represents offices and has only one row per office, making the query faster.
- While not frequently used, setting up suggestions this way can be a solution to complaints about slow loading suggestions, thereby enhancing user experience.

## Expert - Extensions

### Extends with explores

- **What are Extends?**
  - The `extends` keyword in Looker allows you to create a new object that inherits properties from an existing object. Useful for code reusability and avoiding duplication.
  
- **Basic Usage**
  - First, specify the object you wish to extend (e.g., a view or explorer). Next, create a new object using `extends` to inherit properties from the original object.

- **Example: Transactions for California**
  - Created a new explorer called "Transactions California" that extends an existing "Sales Explorer". Added a SQL `WHERE` clause to filter only California transactions. This avoids duplicating code and makes management easier.

- **Nested Extends**
  - It's possible to have multiple layers of `extends`, inheriting properties through a chain of explorers. For example, "Transactions California Customer 17" extends from "Transactions California", which in turn extends from "Sales Explorer".

- **Overriding Properties**
  - While extending, you can override properties like labels or SQL `WHERE` clauses, making the new object a modified version of the original.

- **Challenges & Tips**
  - Be cautious when overriding, especially SQL clauses, to ensure queries run as expected. For example, you need to use the word "AND" instead of the ampersand in BigQuery.

### Extends with views

- The lecture expands on the concept of "extends" in Looker, emphasizing its flexibility and application beyond explorers.
- It demonstrates how you can use "extends" to create a new view called "office2" that inherits properties from an existing "office" view.
- Adding new dimensions to "office2" is simple. For example, you can include "head salesperson ID" by defining a new dimension with its corresponding SQL statement.
- Once the new view is defined, you can easily substitute "office2" for "office" in your existing explorer, updating the joins and relationships accordingly.
- Finally, it's mentioned that "extends" can also be applied to dashboards. This will be covered in more detail in future lectures.

### Sets

- The lecture introduces the concept of "sets" in Looker, which allows you to group related fields together in a view for easier management and reference.
- A set is defined within a LookerML view and contains a list of fields that belong to that set. For example, you could create a set named "transaction related groupings" and include fields like "Transaction ID", "Transaction Date", "Is Expensive", and "State".
- Using sets makes it simpler to manage your fields, especially in complex views with multiple categories of fields like transactional, financial, or customer data.
- Sets are particularly useful in "drill fields" or any other parameter where specifying fields is required. You can refer to the entire set instead of individual fields, making it easier to update and maintain.
- Sets offer a flexible and organized way to manage fields, especially as your Looker projects grow in complexity.

### Tests

- Importance and implementation of unit tests in Looker emphasized.
- Unit tests validate the integrity of underlying data before it is displayed to the user.
- Tutorial demonstrates creating a test for unique Transaction IDs in Sales Explorer.
  - Specify Explorer source, column to check (Transaction ID), and sort order.
  - Add assertion to confirm Transaction ID count equals one, indicating no duplicates.
- Running the test checks data integrity. A failed test indicates an issue requiring attention.
- Tests can be manual or automated for daily checks.
- Tests can vary in complexity and are crucial for maintaining data quality in larger Looker projects.

### Explore fields and always_where settings

- The lecture focuses on two key settings in Looker's "Explore" interface: limiting visible fields and applying a constant SQL "WHERE" clause.
  - To limit fields, you can edit them directly in the "View" or "Explore" options. 
    - Example: Limit visible fields to "Office Name," "Transaction ID," and "Customer ID" for greater focus.
  - Use the SQL "Always WHERE" clause to apply consistent filtering.
    - Example: To display only transactions from California, set a WHERE clause so that users can't modify this criterion.
- These settings are vital for controlling user experience and ensuring data integrity.
  - "Limit Fields" is commonly used for cleaner, more focused dashboards.
  - "Always WHERE" is useful for imposing data quality or restrictions automatically.
- These customizations are among the most frequently used and tested, making them crucial for Looker users to understand.

## Expert - Dashboards

### Loading updated data

- This module is focused on using LookML to create dashboards.
  - First, to ensure everyone is working with the same data, a LookML file is provided in the resources section.
  - Students are instructed to copy and paste this file into their LookML folder.

- The training utilizes the Quick Labs E-commerce project.
  - For those not using Quick Labs, any project can be used.
  - The LookML file being imported includes complete and comprehensive data, which has been previously discussed in the course.

- The objective is to bring uniformity in data among all learners.
  - This complete dataset is the same as what is used in the user analyst section of the course.

- The next video will provide a detailed walkthrough of the data.
  - This will set the stage for dashboard development, using this more complete and robust data set.

### Creating your first dashboard

- The lesson focuses on creating LookML dashboards, emphasizing that prior knowledge of Looker, especially from the user analyst course, is crucial.
  - Dashboards are initiated in the file browser section, by clicking the plus button to add a new dashboard file.
  - The example used is named "Monthly Sales Dashboard."

- Dashboard Settings:
  - Title: Specifies the name that appears on the dashboard.
  - Description: Provides an overview of what the dashboard represents.
  - Layout Options, Tile Size, Filters: Various customization features, to be covered later.

- Elements, Filters, and Embed Style:
  - Elements section defines what will appear on the dashboard.
  - Filters section remains empty for now but is available for future use.
  - Embed Style allows for aesthetic changes like background color and font size.

- View & Edit:
  - To view the dashboard, navigate to folders and find the new dashboard.
  - The dashboard is currently empty but ready for new elements.
  - Edits made in LookML will reflect upon refreshing the dashboard page.

- Practical Example:
  - Changed the title from "Monthly Sales" to "Monthly Sales Dashboard."
  - Added a description summarizing the dashboard's purpose ("This summarizes the monthly sales of Element Rental").

### Creating your first element

- The tutorial moves to creating the first element (or tile) for the LookML dashboard.
  - The "easy way" to create an element involves manually building the dashboard tile and copying its LookML code into the main dashboard file.

- Steps to Create Element:
  1. Navigate to folders and create a new dashboard called "Scratch."
  2. Add a dashboard tile based on the desired analysis, e.g., "Total Sales by Office."
  3. Run the analysis and choose the desired chart type (e.g., bar graph).
  4. Click on the gear icon and select "Get Look" to obtain the LookML code for the tile.

- Importing Element into Main Dashboard:
  - Copy the LookML code for the tile into the main dashboard's LookML file.
  - Ensure proper indentation and format for the code.
  - Click "Save Changes" and run data tests to validate the code.
  
- Element Customization:
  - Directly edit the LookML code for granular control (e.g., change title, add fields).
  - Changes are updated live on the dashboard upon refreshing.

- Final Note:
  - The tutorial highlights the convenience of starting with a manually created tile and customizing it further by editing the LookML code.
  - Upcoming lessons will focus on other editable parameters for dashboard elements.

### Newspaper layout - element location and size 1

- **Creating Dashboard Elements**: This lesson focused on the easy way to populate a Looker dashboard by manually creating a dashboard tile and then using the "Get Look" function to generate code. You can paste this code into your dashboard file.
  
- **Element Parameters**: Introduction to the most complex parameters, `row`, `col`, `width`, and `height`. These help define the size and layout of elements in the dashboard.
  
- **Newspaper Layout**: This is the default and most commonly used layout in Looker. It breaks down your dashboard into a 24-column grid.
  
  - **Width**: To set the element width, divide 24 by the number of desired columns. Default width is eight columns.
  - **Height**: By default, elements are six rows tall. You can change this manually.
  
- **Best Practices**: The 24-column grid is recommended because it can be divided by 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, etc., offering flexibility and adaptability to different screen sizes.
  
- **Upcoming Topics**: The course will cover the parameters `row` and `col`, and also introduce other layout options, although Newspaper is the most commonly used.

This information will be useful when you wish to precisely position and size your dashboard elements in Looker.

### Newspaper layout - element location and size 2

- **Row and Column**: Unlike `width` and `height` that define size, `row` and `col` parameters determine the position of the element in the Looker dashboard.
  
  - **Coordinates**: Think of your dashboard as a 24-column grid. The `row` and `col` parameters set the top-left point coordinates of the element. By default, these are at 0,0.
  
  - **Positioning**: Changing `col` to 12 would move the element to the right side of the dashboard, aligning it at the 12th column. Rows work similarly for vertical positioning.
  
- **Adding Multiple Elements**: You can add more elements to your dashboard, but you need to be mindful of their positions so they don’t overlap.
  
  - **Troubleshooting**: The tutorial also briefly touched on error tracing to identify issues in your dashboard setup.
  
- **Swapping Elements**: Simply change the `row` and `col` parameters of two elements if you wish to swap their positions.

Understanding `row` and `col` alongside `width` and `height` gives you full control over element sizing and positioning in Looker's Newspaper layout.

### Model and explore parameters

- **Looker Update**: A recent Looker update has removed options for other layout types like 'Static Grid' or 'Tile', focusing on the Newspaper layout.

- **Benefits of Other Layouts**: Although not currently available, other layouts like Tile or Grid allow you to specify element dimensions in pixels. 

- **Newspaper Layout**: It's the default and most commonly used layout in Looker dashboards. 

- **User Preference**: The instructor is open to creating tutorials for other layouts if they become available and if there's user interest.

This update suggests that mastering the Newspaper layout is essential, as it is the primary layout type currently supported in Looker.

### Type parameter

- **'Type' Parameter**: Specifies the type of visualization (column, bar, map, etc.) for the dashboard element.

- **Limited Quick Help**: Looker's quick help isn't very informative, but you can find the different types available in Looker's documentation.

- **Similar & Unique Parameters**: Similar types like column and bar share visualization parameters. However, unique types like maps have specific parameters (e.g., borders, colors).

- **Manual vs Scratch Method**: While you can manually change the type and adjust parameters, using a scratch dashboard for the initial setup is recommended. You can then copy and paste the configuration.

- **Errors & Compatibility**: Mismatch between visualization type and available fields can lead to errors (e.g., using a map without location data).

- **Fine-tuning Parameters**: Features like 'zoomable' and 'pannable' can be manually turned on/off. 

This tutorial elaborates on how to effectively use the 'Type' parameter to set the visualization type in Looker, outlining the importance of choosing the right type and configuring corresponding parameters.

### Visualization parameter

- **Visualization Parameters**: These settings depend on the element type you've chosen (e.g., map, column chart). 

- **Reference Guide**: Looker provides an easily accessible reference guide that details what each parameter means and its available options.

- **Clear vs Ambiguous Parameters**: Some parameters like 'map_zoomable' are self-explanatory, while others may require a deeper look into the reference guide.

- **Example of Use**: If unsure about what 'map_marker_type' means, consult the reference guide to learn it can be set to 'circle' or 'none'.

- **Best Practices**: 
  - For significant changes, it's advisable to use the "scratch method" by creating the visualization in a scratch dashboard first. 
  - Copy the 'LookML' to paste into your actual dashboard afterward.

The tutorial emphasizes the importance of familiarizing yourself with Looker's extensive list of visualization parameters for different element types. The reference guide is highlighted as a valuable resource for understanding the impact and options of each parameter.

### Refresh and autorun parameter

- **autorun Parameter**: 
  - Determines whether the dashboard runs automatically upon opening. 
  - Default is set to 'true', meaning it will fetch the latest data. 
  - Be cautious; setting this to 'true' on query-intensive dashboards can be costly.

- **refresh Parameter**: 
  - Sets an automatic refresh time interval for the dashboard (e.g., 2 hours, 10 minutes, 1 day). 
  - Useful for dashboards displayed on screens or embedded in websites. 
  - Avoid short intervals like 20 seconds due to high computational cost.

Both 'autorun' and 'refresh' parameters are designed to manage how up-to-date your dashboard data is. 'Autorun' is ideal for ensuring you always get the most current data upon opening, but be mindful of the computational cost for heavy queries. The 'refresh' parameter allows you to set time intervals for automatic data refresh, highly useful for dashboards that are constantly displayed. Both settings are critical for data currency but use them wisely to avoid unnecessary computational expense.

### Crossfilter

- **What is Cross Filtering?**: 
  - Allows a selection in one dashboard element to affect all other elements. 
  - For example, clicking on data from "California" will filter other elements to show only data from California.

- **Requirements for Cross Filtering**: 
  - Two parameters need to be set: `preferred_viewer` and `crossfilter_enabled`.
  
- **`preferred_viewer` Parameter**: 
  - Sets the type of dashboard renderer. 
  - Recommended to use "dashboards_next", which uses a React-based renderer. 
  - Important for those using older versions of Looker.
  
- **`crossfilter_enabled` Parameter**: 
  - Enables cross filtering when set to 'true'.

- **Benefits and Flexibility**: 
  - Allows filtering of data through multiple elements. 
  - More intuitive than having separate filters. 
  - Can filter using more than one element to refine data in other elements.

The tutorial discusses the importance and process of enabling cross filtering in Looker dashboards. Two parameters (`preferred_viewer` and `crossfilter_enabled`) must be set to utilize this feature effectively. The flexibility of cross filtering allows for a more intuitive and dynamic user experience in dashboard interactions.

### Filters - adding a regular filter

- **Concept of Filters**:
  - Different from cross-filtering.
  - Appears at the top of regular dashboards.
  - Allows users to filter data based on specific criteria.

- **How to Add a Filter**: 
  - Filters are added the same way as elements.
  - Can have multiple filters on a dashboard.
  
- **Configuration Details**:
  - Title: "Select State"
  - Type: Field filter
  - Model & Explorer: Use the same model as the elements (`training_e-commerce` and explorer `sales`).
  - Field: Sales.state
  
- **Additional Parameters**:
  - Default Value: Not specified in this example.
  - Allow Multiple Values: Set to 'true'.
  - Required: Set to 'false'.

This tutorial covers how to add a simple filter to a Looker dashboard. Filters can be added just like elements and are a way to allow users to refine the data displayed. The example uses a "Select State" filter, which uses the field filter option. The model and explorer are the same as the elements in the dashboard. Additional parameters like allowing multiple values and whether the filter is required can also be configured.

### Filters - activating the filter using Listen

- Refresh the dashboard to view the filter. Filter options come from the `Sales` explorer and specifically the `state` column.
- "Allow Multiple Values" setting enables the selection of multiple values, but selecting doesn’t change the data yet.
- Simply adding a filter doesn't make it operational on dashboard elements; they need to be linked to specific elements.
- Use Looker's `listen` parameter to associate the filter with an element. The syntax involves defining the filter an element should listen to and specifying the applicable field.
- After saving and refreshing the dashboard, the filter can be tested by selecting specific states. This makes the filter functional and linked to the dashboard elements.

### Filters - deploying the filter

- Correct the syntax for specifying the column in the filter: Use a dot (.) instead of an underscore (_). The correct format is `view_name.column_name`, for example, `sales.state`.
- After correcting the syntax and saving, the filter becomes operational for the linked dashboard element.
- The `listen` parameter allows individual elements to respond to specified filters. Multiple elements can listen to multiple filters, forming a many-to-many relationship.
- Updating one filter can change multiple elements on the dashboard, depending on how you've configured the `listen` parameters.
- A common practice is to have all elements listen to all filters to avoid user confusion.
- Future videos will focus on different filter configurations, types, and how they correspond to different fields.

### Filters - different filter types

- Looker offers different filter types: Field Filter, Date Filter, String Filter, and No Filter.
- Field Filter: This is the default and most flexible option. It auto-suggests filter values based on the selected field.
  - If you switch the field to a "transaction date," the filter becomes time-based.
- String Filter: Limits you to string input. No suggestions are given.
  - This is static and doesn't adapt to the data type of the field.
  - If you switch to a non-string field, it leads to errors.
- Date Filter: Explicitly for date inputs, doesn't adapt to other types.
- No Filter: Turns off filter functionality.
- Explicit Filters: String, Date, and No filters don't adapt to the type of the field.
- Implicit Filter: Field Filter adapts to the type of field selected and offers suggestions.

Use Field Filters for dynamic functionality and suggestions, while explicit filters are rigid but can be useful depending on the use case.

### Filters - UI multi selectors

In this Looker online course, the focus is on enhancing the user interface (UI) of filters in a dashboard. Here are the key points:

- **Default Filter UI**: Initially, Looker provides a basic filter UI where you click a word to access filter options.

- **Creating Custom Filter**: You can create a new filter called 'Customer Type Selection,' sourced from the 'Customer Type' field in the same model and explorer.

- **Listening to Filters**: Elements on the dashboard should be configured to respond to this new filter, enabling dynamic updates.

- **UI Configurations**: The UI can be customized further using the 'UI_config' parameter.
  - Types: Button Group, Checkboxes, Tag List, etc.
  - Each type can be configured with its own sub-parameters like options for selection.

- **Troubleshooting**: Be attentive to syntax and parameter names; the course demonstrates resolving issues like incorrect 'UI_config' syntax.

- **Other UI Types**: The course also mentions other UI types like range sliders for numeric fields and directs users to a reference page for a full list of UI options.

Note: Use the correct syntax ('UI_config' not 'UI-config') to avoid errors. The course emphasizes the importance of debugging as a part of the learning process.

### Filters - UI single selectors

In this section of the Looker online course, the emphasis shifts from multiple selection filter types to single selection filter types. Here are the key takeaways:

- **Single vs. Multiple Selection**: Single selection types restrict the user to selecting only one value in the filter, unlike multiple selection types.

- **Dropdown Menu**: A simple way to enforce single selection is to use a dropdown menu in the UI config. This replaces the multiple-choice 'tag list' with a single selection dropdown.
  
- **Optional Selection**: Using 'required: false' in the config allows users to opt-out of making a selection but limits them to choosing one value if they opt-in.

- **Other Single Selection Types**: Two other commonly used single selection UI elements are 'Button Toggles' and 'Radio Buttons'.
  - Button Toggles: Modern and versatile, they provide a set of clickable buttons for single selection.
  - Radio Buttons: They look traditional but are effective for single selection, especially if that's the preference of stakeholders like executives.

This section helps you better understand how to customize filters to limit selections to a single choice, offering a user-friendly experience while meeting specific business needs.

### Filters - UI display parameters

In this part of the Looker online course, the topic focuses on different display options available under the UI config. Here are the essential points:

- **Display Options**: Three main display options exist - 'In-line', 'Pop-over', and 'Overflow'.
  
  - **In-line**: Displays the filter directly in the UI. Useful for a limited number of filter options but can be overwhelming for large sets.
  
  - **Pop-over**: Requires users to click to reveal filter options. Ideal for long lists of filter points as it doesn't clutter the main interface.
  
  - **Overflow**: Filters appear under a 'More' tab. Allows for grouping multiple filters under a single tab, streamlining the interface.

- **Combining Filters**: 'Overflow' is particularly useful when you have numerous filters. Primary filters can be displayed directly, while secondary or tertiary filters can be grouped under 'More'.

- **Filter Types in Overflow**: You can mix and match filter types in the 'Overflow' tab. For example, radio buttons for some and button toggles for others.

These options allow you to create a user-friendly filtering experience, making it easier for users to find specific data while keeping the UI clean.

### Text elements

In this segment of the Looker online course, the focus is on adding text elements to dashboards. Here are the key details:

- **Text Elements**: Unlike visualizations, text elements serve to provide additional information on the dashboard. These could be instructions, caveats, or contact details.

  - **Parameters**: Text elements have their own set of parameters separate from visual elements like Looker Map or Looker Bar. The parameters are straightforward and easier to configure.

  - **Standard vs. Text-Specific**: While the standard parameters like 'name', 'type', 'height', 'width', 'top', 'left', 'row', and 'col' remain, text-specific parameters like 'title', 'subtitle', and 'body' are added.

- **Configuration**: 
  - Set the type to 'text'.
  - Define dimensions ('height' and 'width').
  - Fill in text-specific parameters ('title', 'subtitle', and 'body').

- **Use Cases**: Text elements are versatile. They can be placed at the beginning for instructions or at the end for contact info. They're also used for adding disclaimers or caveats about the data.

By adding text elements, you make your dashboard more user-friendly and informative.
